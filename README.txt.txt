Gameplay:

- Monsters: There are 2 monsters in the game that are going around the play space randomly. They stay within the bounds of the play space.
- Player: The player is controlled by key input given by the user
- Box: An initially stationary box that is involved in the game's only objective 
- Goal: A visual indicator involved in the game's only objective

Objective: The player has to push the box around the play space to move it as close as possible to the 'goal' icon

Lose State: The player dies if hit by any monster
Win State: The player wins if box comes really close to the goal icon

NOTE: Sometimes the collisions act a little weird and multiply the velocities to huge values which leads to unexpected outcomes.
